    <h1> My Biography </h1>
    <div id = "biotext">
      I was born in Nashua, New Hampshire on March 28, 1991. I have lived in Pelham, NH my entire life.
      I am a Chemistry and Comp Sci double major, and I hope to somehow combine the two fields by 
      working as a programmer in either a chemistry or a biology lab. I have a diverse set of interests, ranging
      from politics and music to basketball and writing. I have been known to ruffle some feathers around Tufts :)
